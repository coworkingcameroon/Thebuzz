  p <strong>Cowork Buzz</bstrong> pops-up as an <strong>event dedicated to all things cowork</strong>, curated with a special touch. The buzz is huge! Cowork is here to stay and all the <strong>cowork founders, space managers, people engaged</strong>, lovers and curious of this movement should come together and understand where the future leads us. 


  p Letâ€™s join experiences to understand and discuss the current state of this community, what are the trends, common difficulties and strengths, ways to help each other, <strong>unite and grow</strong>.


  p The event will take place one week after the #[a(href="http://coworkingeurope.net/" target="_blank") Coworking Europe Conference 2016] and this will allow us to use Cowork Buzz as a way to debrief the <strong>national community</strong> about what happened in Brussels.
