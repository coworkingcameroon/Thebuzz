  p <b>Cowork Buzz</b> pops-up as an <b>event dedicated to all things cowork</b>, curated with a special touch. The buzz is huge! Cowork is here to stay and all the <b>cowork founders, space managers, people engaged</b>, lovers and curious of this movement should come together and understand where the future leads us. 


  p Letâ€™s join experiences to understand and discuss the current state of this community, what are the trends, common difficulties and strengths, ways to help each other, <b>unite and grow</b>.


  p The event will take place one week after the #[a(href="http://coworkingeurope.net/" target="_blank") Coworking Europe Conference 2016] and this will allow us to use Cowork Buzz as a way to debrief the <b>national community</b> about what happened in Brussels.
