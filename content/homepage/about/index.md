**Cowork Buzz** was born in 2016 as an **event dedicated to cowork and coliving**, curated with a special touch. Since the buzz is really huge, we are here to stay and continue bringing the coworking ecosystem forward.

Our main idea is to bring the community together: coworking managers, founders, community managers, people interested in developing a project related to this area. Let's help each other to understand where are we standing, what are the trends, common difficulties, strengths, and **unite and grow**.

This year it will take place in the 12th and 13th of October, itâ€™s just around the corner! So stay in touch, and updated on our news!
