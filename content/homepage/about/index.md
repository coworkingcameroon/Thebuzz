**Cowork Buzz** was born in 2016 as an **event dedicated to cowork and coliving**, curated with a special touch. Since the buzz is really huge, we are here to stay and continue bringing the coworking ecosystem forward.

Our main idea is to bring the community together: coworking managers, founders, community managers, people interested in developing a project related to this area. Let's help each other to understand where are we standing, what are the trends, common difficulties, strengths, and **unite and grow**.

**This year it will take place on 25th and 26th of October**, itâ€™s just around the corner! Tickets will be available very soon! Save the date! :-)

> **Updates on 2019 conference agenda & tickets are coming very soon!**
>
> Meantime, join us at the spring Cowork Buzz Roadshow in Lisbon and Porto.
