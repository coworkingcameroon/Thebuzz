**Cowork Buzz** was born in 2016 as an **event dedicated to cowork and coliving**, curated with a special touch. Since the buzz is really huge, we are here to stay and continue bringing the coworking ecosystem forward.

\
**This year it will take place on 25th and 26th of October** so it’s just around the corner! \
This years edition will be special. Portugal’s potential in the collaborative space industry has grown rapidly and Cowork Buzz is here to bring together the main stakeholders who play a significant role in impacting this growth.  

This year we count with managers of coworking spaces, founders, community managers, people interested in developing a project related to this field, space design innovation companies, real estate groups and students interested in the subject. Let’s help each other to understand where are we standing, what are the trends, common difficulties, strengths, and **unite and grow.**



> Meantime, join us at the spring Cowork Buzz Roadshow in Lisbon and Porto.
